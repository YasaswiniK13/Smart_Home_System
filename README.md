# Smart_Home_System
Smart home system target to improve comfort, quality of life, and safety by monitoring mobility and physiological parameters using sensors. In this project we have a password door lock that saves the password in the internal EEPROM and set an alarm when the password is entered 3 times wrong. Also, we have a temperature sensor detect whenever the place became hot to turn on a fan and LDR detect whenever it gets dark to turn on the light.
RTOS and Arduino based.
